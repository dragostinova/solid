# S.O.L.I.D

S.O.L.I.D is an acronym for the first five object-oriented designprinciples

* ___S - Single-responsiblity principle___

A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.

* ___O - Open-closed principle___

Objects or entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

* ___L - Liskov substitution principle___

Child classes should never break the parent class' type definitions.

* ___I - Interface segregation principle___

A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn't use or clients shouldn't be forced to depend on methods they do not use.

* ___D - Dependency inversion principle___

Entities must depend on abstractions not on concretions. It states that the high level module must not depend on the low level module, but they should depend on abstractions.
